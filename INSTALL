About the Product Registration

The author of Regress Pro believe that it is very important for scientific
software to be published under a free license that allow to study and modify
the source code. The existence of Regress Pro itself was possible thanks to
many free software projects like GCC, the GSL library, GNU Makefile, the FOX
toolkit, the GNU/Linux operating system as a whole and many other tools.

The registration is not meant as a restriction over the software itself, this
latter is available without restriction accordingly to the GNU GPL license.
The registration is meant for the optimized binary package produced by the
author itself and proposed to the users. It should be seen as a facility to
avoid the difficulties of the software compilation and the user should consider
to register the software to contribute to the development of the project and
to reward the author for his work.

If you compile the software by yourself feel free to disable the product
registrations in the file 'makeconfig' but please consider also that the
registration is a contribution for the work of the author and an encouragement
for the further development of the software.
