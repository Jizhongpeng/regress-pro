========================

These are the installation intructions for Regress Pro.

Regress Pro can be compiled both on Windows and on GNU/Linux using GNU Make and GCC.
On Windows the build process was tested using MinGW.

The following libraries are needed to compile Regress Pro:
- GSL library, should work with any recent version. Tested with version
  1.14 and 1.15.

The Meson build system and Ninja build are needed to compile Regress Pro.

To configure a build use the command:

> meson <build-directory>

or

> meson --buildtype=release <build-directory>

to configure a release build.

If the configuration is successful you can build Regress Pro with the commands:

The stand-alone executable will be located in the build directory inside the "fox-gui" folder.

Optinally a script is provided to create a Debian package on GNU/Linux.
