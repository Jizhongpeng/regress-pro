Introduction to Regress Pro
===========================

Overview
--------

Regress Pro is an application for the analysis of spectroscopic ellipsometry and reflectometry data.
The general steps for using the software are:

- load an ellipsometry of reflectometry spectrum
- define a film stack by choosing the material for the substrate and the films
- define a fit strategy by precising one or more fit parameters
- run the fit to extract the optimized values for the parameters
